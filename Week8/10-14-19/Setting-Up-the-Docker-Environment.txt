- Like GitHub, there is a docker hub you can pull, push to
- Docker daemon is a process waits for a request and it processes that request


to spin up the container: docker run [container]
to stop running the container: docker stop [first few characters of container ID]
confirm container stop: docker ps -a
remove a stopped container: docker rm [first few chars of container ID]
remove the layered file system: docker rmi [container] ( will no longer see the container when you do docker images)
