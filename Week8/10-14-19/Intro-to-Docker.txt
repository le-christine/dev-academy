- Docker containers have instructions to spin up the code on different OS
- Different developers can work on different machines, from the same code base

PROS:
- battle tested
- small, take up less space than VMs
- uses less resources
- well documented
- fast execution
- simple
- scale
- fast onboarding
- #'s 

CONS:
- networking: isolating accessibility of some aspects of the container
- prior knowledge
- bad for GUI -> backend
- Can be bottlenecked
- Can't run w/o emulation
- No data persistence
- cross compatibility issues
- root access / overlooked security
