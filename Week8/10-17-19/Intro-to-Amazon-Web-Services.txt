What is a web server?

If you host a website you need a web server.

Traditionally some issues making your own servers include:
- Maintenance; hardware upgrades
- Maintenance; software upgrades

If you opt for AWS you don't have to worry about these issues. AWS is also scalable. Today you might only need a $10 server
but in 5 years when your user base grows to 10M you will need more space.

Key concepts:
Amazon Elastic Computer Cloud (Amazon EC2) runs on a computer located in one of many Amazon data centers
Many EC2 instances can run on one computer or across many.
- if your "home" data center is down another center has a copy of your application and will run it

Some microservices:
Compute - EC2 - creates instances
Storage - S3 - "a thousand" storage
Database - DynamoDB Amazon's version of MongoDB, a NoSQL database
CloudFront - network load balancer
Developer Tools - CodeStar - quickly develop, build and deploy applications on AWS.

alarm status on your instances to be triggered when memory running out, or high traffic, etc
