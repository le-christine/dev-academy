DevOps: Development Operations - if you enjoy Docker this is for you

	- planning (sprints) ->
	- build the app ->
	- testing & integration ->
	- deployment
	- continuous feedback ->
	REPEAT

Before DevOps it was not continuous, you would plan and build, then deploy. Teams would work separately. This led to conflict bc after dev team completed the task, they would take a break until problems arose.

DevOps relieves the tenson between development teams and operation teams by fostering collaboration & breaking down silos.
Allows faster innovation and more responsive to busineeds needs. As a result, code is better quality and can be put into production faster.

workflow may look like:
new code -> testing code -> VCS -> deplyoment 

Since Docker is a container, it can help with the Deployment phase of DevOps

CALMS:
Culture - cross functional collaboration requires soft skills 
Automation - Automation make the process of build, test and deploy faster.
Lean - Focuses heavily on continuous improvement
Measurement - It's important to track internal metric such as time from development to deployment 
Sharing - Sharing goals, successes, failures, and responsibilities bridges the divide between Dev and Ops teams
