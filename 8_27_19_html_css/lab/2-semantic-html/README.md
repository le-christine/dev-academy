## Semantic HTML 

### Exercise

We will be building a website in tribute to *The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air*. A designer has already created the CSS styling for us; we have to add in the HTML for the site.

### Objectives

- Learn about the different roles of HTML and CSS.
- Learn about the different HTML elements available to us, including those that create content and those that group it.
- Learn how to use the HTML validator to create valid HTML.

### Starter Code

You can access the starter code for this exercise [here](https://git.generalassemb.ly/GA-Cognizant/html-css/tree/master/semantic-html-hw/starter-code), including an empty `index.html` page, a `style.css` page created by our designer, and an image we will insert into the page.

Try to get through as much as possible on your own; if you need additional help, read through this [hints file](https://git.generalassemb.ly/GA-Cognizant/html-css/tree/master/semantic-html-hw/starter-code/hints.md).

### Deliverable

This is what the website will look like:
