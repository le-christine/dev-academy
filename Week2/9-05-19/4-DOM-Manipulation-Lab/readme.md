# DOM Manipulation

Can you really _manipulate_ The DOM though?

Yea I didn't think so... Thankfully we're not talking about _that_ Dom.

Today we're going to be practicing DOM manipulation and event handling.

## Learning Objectives

- DOM Manipulation

## Resources

This [DOM Gist](https://gist.github.com/thegitfather/9c9f1a927cd57df14a59c268f118ce86) has a helpful section on DOM querying and creation

## Setup

You're provided a basic website with included `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`. All of your work will go in `script.js` - you shouldn't have to edit `index.html` or `style.css`.

There are empty functions for each part. Don't forget to **call** the function to test its utility.

## Completion

Finish filling out all of the functions set up in `script.js`
