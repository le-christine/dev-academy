Take 10 minutes with a partner to create a pseudocode of the game Concentration.

The user should see a grid of cards. Clicking a card reveals it and allows the user to click another card. If they match, the cards stay up and, if not, they flip back over. Users get a point for every pair they flip. The game ends after one minute or when all of the cards have been matched.

When you're done, we'll spend five minutes sharing approaches as a class.

PROGRAM concentration:
while time is less than 60 seconds:
  START with view of cards
  USE mouse to click a card
  show card
  USE mouse to click another card
  show card
    IF the cards don't match:
      BOTH cards flip over
    IF the cards do match:
      BOTH cards remain flipped
      USER gets one point
  end game
