At the end of every week of class, we recommend doing a 1-hr "week in review" to reflect and recap on what happened in class that week. This will help instructors:
- Solidify key learnings from the week.
- Surface any areas in which students are struggling.
- Check in on how students are doing in general.
- Celebrate wins and highlights.
- Gather feedback to improve teaching and lesson style.

We've outlined two differeent formats that Week in Review can take depending on the needs of the group at that time. However, feel free to use a different format if you prefer! Each format takes roughly 1 hr.

----

## Option 1: Reflection

This option provides instructors and students time to detach from the course content and reflect. The reflection focuses on the following questions:

- Individually, what was a highlight of this past week?
- Identify one area of improvement you'll be focused on for next week.
- Is there anything we've been doing very well?
- Is there anything you would like us to be doing differently next week?
- Please leave a shout-out for a classmate or classmates.

#### Preparation

Before class, create a Google Form (or another similar survey) with the questions above. Students will complete and discuss the form in class.

#### In Class

The class should be split into two groups:
- Group 1 will receive the link to the online survey. On their own, students should think about and write their answers to the questions in the survey.
- Group 2 will be further spit into two groups. Each subgroup will have a discussion lead by a member of the instructional team. The discussion will focus on the questions above. Use your best judgment on which questions to focus the group discussion on.

> The purpose of dividing (and sub-dividing) the class is to create space for smaller group discussions, rather than class-wide conversations in which some students might not have a chance or feel comfortable sharing their thoughts.

Give each group 20 minutes at the first station, and then rotate stations.

After about 40 minutes, bring the group back together to discussion key themes and insights from the survey and the conversations. Continue this discussion for the remaining 20 minutes (or until the class is all talked out).

## Option 2: Lightning Talks

This option provides more of an opportunity to reflect on key concepts covered during the week. Students work in pairs to create a 3-4 minute presentation on one topic that was covered in class in the past week. They will then teach the concept back to the class and answer any questions their classmates might still have about the topic.

#### Preparation

Create a list of key concepts introduced or referenced during class in the past week. Make sure there are enough so that each pair has a different topic.

#### In Class

Show students the list of topics and have each pair choose a different topic to teach.

Give students ~20 minutes to review the topic and put together a presentation. They can create a Github markdown file, Google Slides, or whatever other format they feel comfortable with for their presentation.

The presentations should cover the following questions:
- What is this topic all about?
- How do you "do" it?
- What are the "gotchas" or key things to consider when working with it?

Once students are done with their presentations, have them share them with the class and answer questions. It might be helpful to collect and consolidate presentations into a "resource bank" for the class.
